A simple packet filter using pcap library:

1. To install, clone the repo and then cd into the repo
2. Then run the following: gcc sniffer.c -o sniffer -lpcap
3. Then after it compiles: ./sniffer ip 


You can also replace "ip" in 3 with tcp, arp, etc

The packet sniffer counts the packet number, packet length and displays the payload.
